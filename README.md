# Assignment_7
For CURSE, so far you have:
• Created classes, databases
• Figured out requirements
• Modeled the design process and individual functions
• Created unit and component tests

Now will be the final portion. It is time to use that to complete CURSE. You may keep a text-based UI,
or add GUI if you want (20 bonus points).

Complete CURSE to give the functionality we have done all semester long. This will be the final part of
this series of labs, so make sure it is complete (you will have more than the normal week).

List of necessary functions of CURSE:
All:

• Login, logout
• Search for courses (all or based on some parameter)
Student:

• Add/remove course from semester schedule (based on course ID number)
• Check conflicts in course schedule
• Print individual schedule
Instructor:

• Print course teaching schedule
• Print/search course roster(s)
Admin:

• Add courses to the system
• Remove courses from the system
• Add instructor/students
• Link (or unlink) instructor/student to course

Make a 120-second maximum video demonstrating that your CURSE project works.

In a report (1-5 pages), discuss:

• The high-level design (requirements, goals)
• Process and UML models for the various functions (you should have these from previous labs, just
consolidate and edit as necessary)
• How successful (or not) the various components are
• Give an evaluation of your code’s efficiency. Assume 0 is the least efficient and 100 is the most efficient
possible, where does yours score? Explain
o Explain what portion of the code is MOST efficient and which is LEAST.
o How could you improve the efficiency of all or part of the code?

This report is a combination of all the previous activities and should serve as a summary.

What to submit: Up to a 5-page report for the whole project; a video or link to a video; final code repository
link. Submit code files or links to the folders.

Additional notes: This should be done in teams of 2-3. Document who works on what, as it will factor
into your grade. If you use code from another person or the web, it will be considered either plagiarism or
less satisfactory work. Late assignments will lose 15 points per 24 hour period it is late.
